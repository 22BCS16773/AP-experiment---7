## üìò Easy Problems

1. **Climbing Stairs**  
   A basic DP problem using a bottom-up approach with an array.

2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell a Stock**  
   Implements a greedy and DP mix to track minimum prices and max profits.

3. **Maximum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)**  
   Solves using cumulative sum and greedy reset technique.

4. **House Robber**  
   Demonstrates DP with choices between robbing or skipping each house.

## üìó Medium Problems

5. **Jump Game**  
   Greedy + DP to check if end of array is reachable.

6. **Unique Paths**  
   Uses DFS and memoization to calculate unique paths in a grid.

7. **Coin Change**  
   Bottom-up DP to find minimum number of coins for a given amount.

8. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**  
   Binary search optimization on DP solution.

## üìô Hard Problems

9. **Maximum Product Subarray**  
   Tracks both current min and max product due to negative values.

10. **Decode Ways**  
   Solves with DP considering one-digit and two-digit decode options.

11. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown**  
   Advanced DP tracking buy/sell/cooldown transitions.

12. **Perfect Squares**  
   Solves using a DP approach similar to the coin change problem.

13. **Word Break**  
   Python implementation with recursion and memoization.

14. **Word Break II**  
   Backtracking with memoization to return all valid segmentations.
